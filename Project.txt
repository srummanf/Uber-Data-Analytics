Fact & Dimension Table
Fact Table:
Contains quantitative measures or metrics that are used for analysis
Typically contains foreign keys that link to dimension tables
Contains columns that have high cardinality and change frequently
Contains columns that are not useful for analysis by themselves, but are necessary for calculating metrics


Dimension Table:
Contains columns that describe attributes of the data being analyzed
Typically contains primary keys that link to fact tables
Contains columns that have Iow cardinality and don't change frequently
Contains columns that can be used for grouping or filtering data for analysis
